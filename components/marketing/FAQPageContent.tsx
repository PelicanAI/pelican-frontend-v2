      },
      {
        question: 'What makes Pelican different from other trading tools?',
        answer: 'Unlike traditional platforms that require coding skills or complex interfaces, Pelican uses natural language. Just ask questions like "What caused TSLA to drop yesterday?" or "Compare AAPL vs SPY last quarter" and get instant, actionable insights. One tool instead of 20 browser tabs.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the current status of Pelican?',

      },
      {
        question: 'How does Plain-English Backtesting work?',
        answer: 'Test trading ideas in seconds without writing a single line of code. Just describe your strategy: "Backtest momentum strategy on SPY, last 6 months" and Pelican returns comprehensive results including win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and more.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Context Memory?',
        answer: 'Pelican remembers your trading style, preferences, and past conversations. This means responses get more personalized over time, and you don\'t have to repeat yourself. It\'s like having an assistant who truly knows how you trade.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does Pattern Detection work?',
        answer: 'Pelican\'s AI continuously analyzes market data to find patterns and anomalies you might miss. It can identify trends, correlations, and unusual activity across thousands of tickers, giving you an edge in spotting opportunities.',

    title: 'Pricing',
    icon: '',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How does Pelican\'s pricing work?',
        answer: 'Pelican uses a credit-based pricing system. Credits represent analytical workload—simple queries cost fewer credits, complex analyses cost more. Credits reset monthly and do not roll over.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the subscription tiers?',
        answer: 'Three tiers: Starter ($29/month, 1,000 credits) for exploration and learning, Pro ($99/month, 3,500 credits) for active traders, and Power ($249/month, 10,000 credits) for heavy and professional users.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How many credits do queries cost?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s included in all tiers?',
        answer: 'All tiers include: live data on 10,000+ tickers, plain-English backtesting, context memory across sessions, one-click shareable reports, and all new features as they ship. The only difference is credit allotment.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a free tier or trial?',
        answer: 'There is no free tier. Pelican operates on a paid-from-day-one model. We believe in providing full value from day one rather than a limited experience.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if a query fails?',
        answer: 'System failures automatically refund your credits. We prioritize trust and fairness—you only pay for successful analyses.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How does Pelican compare to Bloomberg or other terminals?',
        answer: 'Pelican is approximately 99% cheaper than institutional terminals. Bloomberg Terminal costs ~$24,000/year, Refinitiv Eikon ~$22,000/year, FactSet ~$12,000/year. Pelican ranges from $348–$2,988/year while delivering institutional-grade reasoning through natural language.',
